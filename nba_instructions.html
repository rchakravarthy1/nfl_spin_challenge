    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    <h3>The game is very laid back, and you can choose whatever rules you want, but generally the rules go something like this:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The goal is to create the best roster possible</li>
        <li>Only one pick can be locked per spin</li>
        <li>Labeled positions must be true position picks. "Bench" players can be any position. Check out the <a href="https://www.nba.com/teams">roster lists </a> to see their official position. </li>
        <li>Optionally, use the notes section to remember which players you picked</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Common Rule Variations Include:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Only one selection per team</li>
        <li>All-Time edition: Can choose player who played on that team at some point</li>
        <li>Active Roster Only: Currently injured players can't be picked</li>
    </ol>
