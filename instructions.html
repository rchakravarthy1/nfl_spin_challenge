    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    <h3>The game is very laid back, and you can choose whatever rules you want, but generally the rules go something like this:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Only one pick can be locked per spin</li>
        <li>WRs should be true WR1, WR2, and WR3. Check out the team's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29098001/nfl-depth-charts-all-32-teams">depth chart</a> to see their official order. </li>
        <li>Only one selection per team</li>
        <li>Optionally, use the notes section to remember which players you picked</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Common Variations Include:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Any WRs for WR1/2/3</li>
        <li>All-Time edition: Any player who played on that team at some point</li>
        <li>Active Roster Only: Currently injured players can't be picked</li>
    </ol>
